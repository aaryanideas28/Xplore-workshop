# declare some variables

x = 10
y = "5"

print(x+y) # come on think, this ain't javascript

num1 , num2 = 6 , 7

print(num1 // num2) # huh this shouldnt output 0, as a bonus can u also round to 2 decimal places?

a , n = 1, 31

for i in range(n):
    a *= 2 # can you replace this loop with a one liner?


# match the correct statements wrt bitwise operators

print("AND operator:", " | ")
print("OR operator:", " ^ ")
print("XOR operator:", " & ")
