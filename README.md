CoC Python Workshop

This repository contains a set of Python tutorials and exercises for students to
practice after studying Python fundamentals. Within main directory we have `python_playground` folder which has `tutorials` for some basic py files for you to get used to the syntax and crux of python, while `test_playground` has various folders like
`basics/`, `intermediate/`, `advanced/`, `miscellaneous/` where you can make changes to the files which are mostly correct but small bugs are there. Hints are there for your help. You may also refer `tutorial_day_2_python.ipynb` given in main directory for the walkthrough of major concepts in brief.

How students should submit solutions

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. In the fork, create a top-level folder named `<githubid>_solutions` (replace `<githubid>` with your GitHub username).
4. Copy both `python_playground\test_playground` and `python_playground/tutorials` to `<githubid>_solutions/` folder. 
5. In the top level directory, make a venv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the necessary dependencies installed 
6. Implement your fixes and solutions inside your copied folder only. Add your own python files to perhaps showcase something that you have learned
7. Commit your changes, push the branch, and open a PR against the upstream repository. Format of PR is provided to you in repo as well.

Have fun learning!
