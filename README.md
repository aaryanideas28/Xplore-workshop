# CoC Python Workshop

Welcome to the CoC Python Workshop repository! 🚀


This repository is designed to help students practice Python after learning the fundamentals, through tutorials, hands-on exercises, and debugging challenges.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🔹 tutorials/ — Learn & Explore

This is your primary learning directory. Use it to understand Python concepts and explore its power.

It is organized into:

- fundamentals/
Learn Python basics such as variables, loops, functions, and data types.

- additional_libs/
Get introduced to commonly used standard and third-party Python libraries.

- data_science/
Dive into BIG DATA & Data Science concepts, including data handling and analysis.

- miscellaneous/
Experiment with powerful and fun Python libraries beyond the basics.

### 🔹 test_playground/ — Practice by Fixing Bugs 🧠

This directory helps you learn by doing.

It contains folders such as:

- basics/
Contains simple bugs covering standard Python, with no module required

- intermediate/
Covers slightly more intermediate concepts still nearing fundamentals but with some standard libraries

- advanced/
Covers codes related to data science, with now fixes and improvements requiring proper understanding and critical thinking.

- miscellaneous/
Covers random extra topics. Difficulty is mix of intermediate and advanced.

-assets/
Contains some datasets and files used by the buggy codes in the above four folders. Also contains a script that was used to generate them.

📌 These files are mostly correct, but include small bugs or logical errors.
💡 Hints are provided to guide you—try fixing the issues on your own!

## 📓 Google Colab Walkthrough

A Google Colab Notebook is provided in the main directory for a quick walkthrough of major Python concepts:

👉 [Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OvQEWr6Wx9XnjLGwWLgw45yIWzP1RoGv)

Use this as:

1. A quick revision guide

2. A reference while solving exercises

## 🎯 Goal of This Repository

1. Strengthen Python fundamentals

2. Learn debugging and problem-solving

3. Explore real-world Python libraries

4. Build confidence through practice

5. Learn format of contribution in open source and work with PRs and issues.

**✨ Have fun learning Python!**
